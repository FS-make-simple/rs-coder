# A simple tool to secure a file for bit errors

This is a simple project that I made during my studies. One can secure a
file with error correction bits - Reed-Solomon code is used. The resulting file
is not bigger than 175% (considering 1MB+ files) and should be (partially)
tolerant to burst errors as well. Obtained 10/10 points.

Use on your own risk.
